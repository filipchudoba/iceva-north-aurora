I cannot provide the actual content for `src/assets/logos/iceva-logo.png` because this is a binary image file (PNG format), not text code. PNG files contain binary image data that cannot be represented as text code.

The AI's comment `// ... keep existing code (moving logo)` was indicating that the existing PNG image file should be moved from its original location to the new `src/assets/logos/` folder, but the actual binary content of the PNG file remains unchanged.

To complete this task, you would need to:
1. Create the `src/assets/logos/` directory
2. Move the existing `iceva-logo.png` file (or `iceva-logo-new.png`) to that directory
3. The binary content of the image file itself doesn't change - it's just relocated
